# Hireon AI Project Roadmap

## Introduction

This document outlines the phased, modular, step-by-step implementation plan for the Hireon AI project. The goal is to build a fast, privacy-first, AI-powered resume reviewer as described in the project's `README.md`. Each phase and module has clear objectives and actionable steps.

| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Regulatory compliance & AI governance**    | EU AI Act categorises hiring tools as *high-risk* systems; in the U.S. the EEOC treats résumé screeners as "selection procedures." Non-compliance exposes you to fines and litigation. ([European Parliament][1], [Mayer Brown][2]) | • Map features to EU AI Act Article 9/10 controls (data-set quality, transparency statements, human oversight).  <br>• Produce annual disparate-impact & bias reports for EEOC/OFCCP. |
| **Bias mitigation & model audit loop**       | Fairness can drift after deployment; regulators expect ongoing testing, not a one-time check.                                                                                                                                       | • Add a quarterly bias-audit pipeline (stratified sampling + statistical significance tests).  <br>• Maintain a panel of synthetic "benchmark résumés" for regression testing.        |
| **Security hardening**                       | You handle file uploads containing PII; that's an attractive target.                                                                                                                                                                | • File-type whitelisting + antivirus scan + content-type validation before parsing. <br>• OWASP top-10 penetration tests each release.                                                |
| **Privacy ops**                              | Privacy-first principle deserves operational proof.                                                                                                                                                                                 | • Automated data-at-rest deletion (e.g., tmpfs / RAM-disk) with audit logs.  <br>• Add a "Right to delete" endpoint/API even if data is ephemeral.                                  |
| **Accessibility & localisation**             | Enterprise buyers often require WCAG 2.1 AA and multi-language support.                                                                                                                                                             | • Accessibility test suite (axe/Pa11y).  <br>• I18n scaffolding; language-agnostic resume parsing (consider spaCy language pipelines).                                                |
| **Observability → Model-quality monitoring** | You log system metrics, but not *why* the AI output changes.                                                                                                                                                                        | • Capture input/output embeddings & key stats (hashed to protect data) for drift detection.                                                                                           |
| **Cost & capacity planning**                 | GPT tokens are a variable COGS driver; uptake spikes after launch.                                                                                                                                                                  | • Add real-time token telemetry + cost dashboards.  <br>• Introduce caching layer for repeated analyses of identical résumés.                                                         |
| **Multi-format ingestion**                   | Users will upload DOCX, ODT, or image-based PDFs.                                                                                                                                                                                   | • Extend parsing layer to python-docx / Tika + fallback OCR (Tesseract) for images.                                                                                                   |
| **User support & feedback loop**             | Needed for continuous improvement and enterprise SLAs.                                                                                                                                                                              | • In-app "Report an issue / suggest improvement" channel wired to ticket system. <br>• SLA metrics (first response, resolution time) in monitoring stack.                             |

### How to integrate

* **Embed** a short **Phase 7: Governance & Scale** (or treat each item as a swim-lane in Phases 5-6) with acceptance criteria and owners.
* **Add checklists** to your Definition of Done—e.g., "Bias test run passes" must be green before merge.
* **Publish** a living **Trust Center** page summarising compliance artefacts, security posture, and audit cadence—buyers now expect it by default.
